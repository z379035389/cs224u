    "The goal of this homework is to explore retrieval-augmented in-context learning. This is an exciting area that brings together a number of recent task ideas and modeling innovations. We will use the [DSP programming library](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dsp) to build systems in this new mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our core task is __open-domain question answering (OpenQA)__. In this task, all that is given by the dataset is a question text, and the task is to answer that question. By contrast, in modern QA tasks, the dataset provides a text and a gold passage, usually with a firm guarantee that the answer will be a substring of the passage. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenQA is substantially harder than standard QA. The usual strategy is to use a _retriever_ to find passages in a large collection of texts and train a _reader_ to find answers in those passages. This means we have no guarantee that the retrieved passage will contain the answer we need. If we don't retrieve a passage containing the answer, our reader has no hope of succeeding. Although this is challenging, it is much more realistic and widely applicable than standard QA. After all, with the right retriever, an OpenQA system could be deployed over the entire Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task posed by this homework is harder even than OpenQA. We are calling this task __few-shot OpenQA__. The defining feature of this task is that the reader is simply a frozen, general purpose language model. It accepts string inputs (prompts) and produces text in response. It is not trained to answer questions per se, and nothing about its structure ensures that it will respond with a substring of the prompt corresponding to anything like an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Few-shot QA__ (but not OpenQA!) is explored in the famous GPT-3 paper ([Brown et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)). The authors are able to get traction on the problem using GPT-3, an incredible finding. Our task here – __few-shot OpenQA__ – pushes this even further by retrieving passages to use in the prompt rather than assuming that the gold passage can be used in the prompt. If we can make this work, then it should be a major step towards flexibly and easily deploying QA technologies in new domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task             | Passage given | Task-specific reader training |Task-specific retriever training  | \n",
    "|-----------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|\n",

    "\n",
    "Just to repeat: your mission is to explore the final line in this table. The core notebook and assignment don't address the issue of training the retriever in a task-specific way, but this is something you could pursue for a final project; [the ColBERT codebase](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) makes easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, this notebook sets up the task and provides starter code. We will be relying on the DSP library, which allows us to define retrieval-augmented in-context learning systems in code. We first provide two fully implemented examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Few-shot OpenQA_: The given input is a question and the goal is to provide an answer. Some _demonstration_ Q/A pairs are sampled from a train set (in our case, SQuAD).\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Few-shot QA with context_: The given input is a question with an associated evidence passage, and the goal is to provide an answer. The _demonstrations_ are now Q/A pairs with associated gold evidence passages. These are sampled from a train set (in our case, SQuAD).\n",
    "\n",
    "The above examples are followed by some assignment questions aimed at helping you to think creatively about the problem. The first of these defines a core system for our target task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Few-shot OpenQA with context_: This is like _few-shot QA with context_ except the passages are now retrieved from a large search index using ColBERT. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second question illustrates how to use the powerful DSP `annotate` function to improve the set of demonstrations used by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a requirement of the bake-off that a general-purpose language model be used. In particular, trained QA systems cannot be used at all, and no fine-tuning is allowed either. See the original system question at the bottom of this message for guidance on which models are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the models we are working with here are _big_. This poses a challenge that is increasingly common in NLP: you have to pay one way or another. You can pay to use the GPT-3 API, or you can pay to use an Eleuther model on a heavy-duty cluster computer, or you can pay with time by using an Eleuther model on a more modest computer.  __For now, though, the Cohere models are free to use, so they should be your first choice; see [setup.ipynb](setup.ipynb) if you don't have an account__."

       "  'context': \"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers.

They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\",\n",

The album formally introduces Beyoncé\\'s alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \"Crazy in Love\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and the top-five songs \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"\\'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \"Sweet Dreams\", and singles \"Diva\", \"Ego\", \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" and \"Video Phone\". The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star.

Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan\\'s Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyoncé\\'s alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \"Crazy in Love\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and the top-five songs \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"\\'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \"Sweet Dreams\", and singles \"Diva\", \"Ego\", \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" and \"Video Phone\". The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift\\'s \"You Belong with Me\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyoncé improvising a re-presentation of Swift\\'s award during her own acceptance speech.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season.

He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season.

The city straddles the Vistula River. It is located in the heartland of the Masovian Plain, and its average elevation is 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level. The highest point on the left side of the city lies at a height of 115.7 metres (379.6 ft) (\"Redutowa\" bus depot, district of Wola), on the right side – 122.1 metres (400.6 ft) (\"Groszówka\" estate, district of Wesoła, by the eastern border). The lowest point lies at a height 75.6 metres (248.0 ft) (at the right bank of the Vistula, by the eastern border of Warsaw). There are some hills (mostly artificial) located within the confines of the city – e.g. Warsaw Uprising Hill (121 metres (397.0 ft)), Szczęśliwice hill (138 metres (452.8 ft) – the highest point of Warsaw in general).',\n",

For instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2% per head and 40% of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction.

Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism\\'s immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\\nQuestion: Immunoassays are able to detect what type of proteins?\\nAnswer: generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent\\n\\nContext:\\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily.

Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism\\'s immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\\nQuestion: Immunoassays are able to detect what type of proteins?\\nAnswer: generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent\\n\\nContext:\\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily.

Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny\\'s Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world\\'s best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé\\'s debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".\\nQuestion: What album made her a worldwide known artist?\\nAnswer: Dangerously in Love\\n\\nContext:\\nComplex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as Immunoassays. Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism\\'s immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\\nQuestion: Immunoassays are able to detect what type of proteins?\\nAnswer: generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent\\n\\nContext:\\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic.\\nQuestion: Why did country borders not affect differences in style within Gothic architecture?\\nAnswer: proximity of some regions\\n\\n---\\n\\nFollow the following format.\\n\\nContext:\\n${sources that may contain relevant content}\\n\\nQuestion: ${the question to be answered}\\n\\nAnswer: ${a short factoid answer, often between 1 and 5 words}\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\nKublai\\'s government after 1262 was a compromise between preserving Mongol interests in China and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects.

Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism\\'s immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\\nQuestion: Immunoassays are able to detect what type of proteins?\\nAnswer: generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent\\n\\nContext:\\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily.

Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism\\'s immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\\nQuestion: Immunoassays are able to detect what type of proteins?\\nAnswer: generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent\\n\\nContext:\\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily.

Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny\\'s Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world\\'s best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé\\'s debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".\\nQuestion: What album made her a worldwide known artist?\\nAnswer: Dangerously in Love\\n\\nContext:\\nComplex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as Immunoassays. Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism\\'s immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\\nQuestion: Immunoassays are able to detect what type of proteins?\\nAnswer: generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent\\n\\nContext:\\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic.\\nQuestion: Why did country borders not affect differences in style within Gothic architecture?\\nAnswer: proximity of some regions\\n\\n---\\n\\nFollow the following format.\\n\\nContext:\\n${sources that may contain relevant content}\\n\\nQuestion: ${the question to be answered}\\n\\nAnswer: ${a short factoid answer, often between 1 and 5 words}\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\nThe principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut.

Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism\\'s immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\\nQuestion: Immunoassays are able to detect what type of proteins?\\nAnswer: generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent\\n\\nContext:\\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily.

Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism\\'s immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\\nQuestion: Immunoassays are able to detect what type of proteins?\\nAnswer: generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent\\n\\nContext:\\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily.

Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism\\'s immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\\nQuestion: Immunoassays are able to detect what type of proteins?\\nAnswer: generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent\\n\\nContext:\\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily.

Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".\n",

Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work, Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work. Tesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work. However, when he did engage in a social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla.

The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste.

Due to his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the shaman Kokochu that the Eternal Blue Sky had set aside the world for Temüjin, Temüjin began rising to power. In 1186, Temüjin was elected khan of the Mongols. However, Jamukha, threatened by Temüjin's rapid ascent, quickly moved to stop Temüjin's ambitions. In 1187, he launched an attack against his former friend with an army of thirty thousand troops. Temüjin hastily gathered together his followers to defend against the attack, but he was decisively beaten in the Battle of Dalan Balzhut. Jamukha horrified people greatly and harmed his image by boiling seventy young male captives alive in cauldrons, alienating many of his potential followers and eliciting sympathy for Temüjin.
